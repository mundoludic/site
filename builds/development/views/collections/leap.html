			<h4>The Leap S</h4>

			<p>The Leap Classic has led the way as deLaCour's first slim and more wearable timepiece. The Leap Classic has an enigmatic new design, donning a variety of colored baguette sapphires as well as round diamonds accenting the dial, making this timepiece a favorite high-end accessory for the urban-chic.</p>

			<p>Adorning the dial is a combination of atrina vaxilum extra white, which help exalt the Roman numbers. Three hands show the hour, minute and seconds.</p>

			<p>The Leap Classic is made up of 18K rose gold case and a black or colored hand-stitched crocodile band.</p>
