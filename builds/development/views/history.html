				<p><strong>In 1989</strong>, friends Alfred Terzibachian and Louai Kuzbari met Pierre Koukjian, then a famous and successful jewelry designer. A strong friendship and connection was developed and soon the three were working together, rooting concrete foundations for a future successful enterprise.</p>

				<p><strong>From 1990 to 1999</strong>, the three worked with many high-end leaders in the world of Swiss watch making and jewelry powerhouses, providing innovative designs and marketing expertise. Every bespoke timepiece and jewelry design created was sent to different workshops within Geneva to be able to manage an intricate audit per piece and guarantee top quality control, assuring their clientele an authentic pièce de résistance. Alfred, Louai and Pierre acquired all the experience and thorough knowledge needed to create their own identity and in 2003, they decided to launch deLaCour. The three friends built what would be one of the most creative, innovative and original Swiss timepiece companies. Strategically, the decision of working with different workshops within Switzerland was the flexibility of interchanging different timepiece parts and ideas to create one unique timepiece within a quick turnaround and outstanding quality. Hence, deLaCour only creates limited edition collections to satisfy an exclusive and demanding niche clientele.</p>

				<p>deLaCour was established to offer alternative and exclusive creations to the world of luxury timepieces; complicated movements that have been delicately and individually handcrafted for those who have a passion for state-of-the-art masterpieces, and a collection of distinct models to suit from the jet-set to the most meticulous timepiece avant-garde collector.</p>

				<p>deLaCour finds its inspiration in an uncharted future and defines it with exceptional limited edition timepiece collections as a result of an independent, self-assured vision, not in response to fleeting fashion trends. Thus, deLaCour’s award winning slogan, “Since Tomorrow” defines a notion of consistently forward-looking modernism, self-expression and refinement.</p>

				<p>Since the very beginning, deLaCour has always participated and been very aware of various important charity associations, and wanted to help and be a part of their events all over the world.</p>

				<p>Each and every <a href="http://delacour.ch/collection" alt="deLaCour Collection">deLaCour Collection</a> is the result of an authentic and individual journey the brand takes on without preconceived notions or constraints.</p>

				<p>It is a pleasure to introduce deLaCour and let you experience the philosophy, ‘Since Tomorrow’ through our timepieces. deLaCour is a reflection of our time.</p>

				<p><strong>In 2003</strong>, deLaCour unveiled the world first <a href="http://delacour.ch/collections/bichrono" alt="The Bichrono collection">Bichrono collection</a> at the luxurious watch and jewelry show in Basel, Switzerland. Within the same period, a jewelry timepiece line, The Heart Riders was born, using the same iconic deLaCour shape.</p>

				<p><strong>2004</strong> – The innovative and unique <a href="http://delacour.ch/collections/bitourbillon" alt="The Bitourbillon">Bitourbillon</a>, contains a movement with two tourbillons linked by a differential, of which one would be at 5 o’clock and the second at 7 o’clock as well as a shooting star at 12 o’clock. Thus, in 2004, after 3 years of research, deLaCour developed their first interactive, innovative, login-based portal, were clients can choose their unique personalization. Since then, deLaCour has been placed in a different tier within the luxury watch-making sector, considering them the first high end timepiece company to develop this creative, interactive devise.</p>

				<p><strong>In 2005</strong>, deLaCour opened their doors to their first showroom/boutique in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

				<p><strong>2006</strong> – deLaCour extended <a href="http://delacour.ch/collections/bichrono" alt="The Bichrono collection"> The Bichrono collection</a> and created the Bichrono SII. A redesign of the flat dial containing an enameled diagram, to a more intricate display of dials to exalt the beautiful design of this timepiece. Not only a pioneer in its novel use of dual chronographs, other materials used to produce these exceptional dials has been a product of constant research and innovation. World premieres, such as the unique textural traits of organic components such as natural precious wood (Bichrono Hommage) and the delicate tobacco leaf (Bichrono Fidelidad), leather, are amongst these exclusive materials used on the Bichrono SII.

				<p><strong>2007</strong> – Taking a bold step away from the stereotypical, deLaCour introduced a vibrant and daring design, <a href="http://delacour.ch/collections/saqra" alt="The Saqra">The Saqra</a>. This line is inspired by the “shakra”, the energy in the center of the human body, a recurrent source of inspiration for deLaCour. A perfect balance between the softness of the circle and the boldness of the square. From this line derives the following collections: Saqra Weekend, Saqra Bitime, Saqra Grande Reserve. Saqra Ego whose collection consists of a daring combination of rose gold and titanium. Saqrono, which includes a chronograph movement with a 42 hour power reserve and maintaining the rose gold and titanium case Saqra Triplex Iridium‘s titanium case is adorned by iridium metal plates, which is sometimes confused as gold considering its yellowish hue. Iridium is the most corrosion resistant metal, which repels the effects of acid and other acridic chemicals; it is an extremely rare component, difficult to work with and expensive. This Saqra Triplex Iridium is named not only for its rare armor, but also from its three time zones which contain a large flying tourbillon-based manual-winding movement.</p>
